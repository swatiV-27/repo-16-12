Sure  — what kind of **Python code** do you want?

You can tell me, for example:

* what the program should **do** (e.g., calculator, game, data analysis, automation)
* your **level** (beginner / intermediate)
* whether it’s for **school**, a project, or just learning
* any specific **topic** (loops, functions, lists, files, AI, etc.)

Once you give a bit more detail, I’ll write the code for you.
