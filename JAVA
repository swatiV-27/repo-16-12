Java is a popular, object-oriented programming language and platform, known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability, allowing code to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Its primary uses include building Android apps, enterprise software, web applications, big data tools, game development, and cloud-based services, making it a versatile choice for everything from mobile devices to large servers.
